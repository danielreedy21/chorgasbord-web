### Chorgasbord

Welcome to Chorgasbord, this is an application that provides social media around dashboards of people's repeating tasks.
Users add chores to their chorgasbord, and get a colorful display, with the colors representing how soon (relative to the time in-between performing that task) the chore should be finished.
Users can set specific chores to be public or private, and the public chores can be viewed by their followers or other users.


### Tech
To complete this application, I am using the new Next 13 App router, and Prisma for an ORM that connects to a neon database.
Private chores are not yet encrypted (coming soon), so please do not create chores that you would not want an administrator (me) to see.
